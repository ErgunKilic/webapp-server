### ViM

Vim has been set up with Vundle and some plugins. To install them run:

    $ vim +PluginInstall +qall

Then, fell free to modify `~/.vimrc`.

By default, your editor is `nano`, you can change this by editing the `$EDITOR`
variable in `~/.bash_profile`.

In case, you wanna learn a bit more about vim, run the `vimtutor` command. Why
would I learn vim anyway? Because, being able to work on a remote machine with
only a command-line interface is a skill you want to have.
